        description: 'The paintings in this series are dotted with elements of wonder and play inviting the viewer in. They recall the voice of children marveling at nature and discovering life as divine. Remembering our childhood and embracing the mystery of life can bring back a sense of wonder for the world. From time to time, especially in challenging times, we forget what we mean when we say "playfulness." We forget that there is such a thing. We forget that we are capable of being playful. Thinking of the amazement a kid experiences when blowing bubbles and seeing the iridescent circles they produce or when finding a glittering stone on a walk. It’s like soaking your soul in a healing bath. This painting Let\'s imagine invokes curiosity and reminds the viewer of what it was like to see the world through the eyes of a child. The dark shapes consisting of transparent layers of browns and greens contrast beautifully with the muted turquoise, pinks and greys.',

        description: 'Among our body movements, there are hand actions that can even change the world. Such actions change thoughts, ours and others. These are gestures. Gestures appear first, before words. In essence, gestures are substitutes for words. Many gestures are used subconsciously, and reveal to us the essence much more vividly than just sounds. In this artwork, I have revealed the metaphor of a hand with a flower, which in unison reveals the essence without a face. More than million ink dots applied by hand were spent on the creation of the work. I master the art of patience, leaving no room for mistakes in this seemingly small artwork.
